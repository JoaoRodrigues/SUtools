# SUtools

Tools for autogenerating fortran registration code. I must have done
this at least three times and forgot to organize the code each time.
Time to repo it.

This is now a full fledged R package. See vignette for how to use these
tools.

This package bundles the `mortran` preprocessor, with slight
modifications.

Install from GitHub using `devtools` or `remotes`, thus:

``` r
devtools::install_github("bnaras/SUtools")
```

or

``` r
remotes::install_github("bnaras/SUtools")
```
